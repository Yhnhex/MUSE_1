\section{Introduction}


The current report collates the results and conclusions derived from the completion of the high frequency vibroacoustic analysis exercise for the \textit{Structures for Space Use} subject in the Master's Degree in Space Systems (MUSE) at the Technical School of Aeronautical and Space Engineering (ETSIAE) of the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM).

Section \ref{sec: stat} comprises the statement data and the objectives of the work, whereas Section \ref{sec: ft} provides a summary of the hypotheses and models employed in the calculations to represent the physics of the problem. Section \ref{sec: res} illustrates the outcomes achieved, consistent with the proposed approach, and Section \ref{sec: conc} appraises the conclusions that were drawn from both the results and the execution of the work.
